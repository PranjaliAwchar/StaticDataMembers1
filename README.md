This file is dedicated to the concept of the Static Data Member and Static Function used in the praogramming.
A static data member in a class is a variable that belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It's shared among all instances, and there's only one copy of it in memory.
A static function in a class is a method that belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. It can be called on the class itself, not requiring an instance, and it cannot access non-static members directly.
